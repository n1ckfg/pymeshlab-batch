Fast and Robust Edge Extraction in Unorganized Point Clouds (Dena Bazazian, Josep R Casas, Javier Ruiz-Hidalgo) - DICTA2015 <br />
<br />

## Code

#### Python version
* ```Difference_Eigenvalues.py``` is a source code for extracting the edges of a point cloud based on Python 3 and [pyntcloud](https://github.com/daavoo/pyntcloud) library. <br />
* Installation is based on ```conda install pyntcloud -c conda-forge``` or ```pip install pyntcloud```. <br />


#### C++ version
* ```Difference_Eigenvalues.cpp``` includes the C++ source code for extracting edges in unorganized point clouds. <br />

* ```F1Score-Eigenvalues.cpp``` is for computing the accuracy of edge extraction. <br />


## Dataset
* We have created some artificial point clouds in order to have a labeled dataset, since we have both the point clouds and ground truths. Hence, in the ``` ArtificialPointClouds``` and ```GroundTruth ``` directories, you can find the artificial point clouds and their correspond ground truth. <br />

* In addition, in the ``` artificial_point_cloud.cpp ``` you can access to the source code that we have generated those artificial point clouds. <br />
